# Oxide

Oxide brings the next-generation HTML renderer [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht/) to the greater .NET ecosystem. Oxide works on any standard .NET environment that supports
.NET 6.0, and game engines such as Stride and Unity.

## Installation

We have not provided NuGet packages as we're still on the process of tidying out the repository and squashing some nasty bugs on the library. However, the library is usable.

## Developing

You need the following Prerequisites to develop on Oxide:

- .NET 6.0
- Your game engine of choice (Optional).

However, we also provide pre-built environments via Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces.
